# Both GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions allow you to run workflows at a specific interval. 
# In GitLab CI/CD, pipeline schedules are configured with the UI, while in GitHub Actions you can trigger a workflow on a scheduled interval with the "on" key.
# For more information, see "Events that trigger workflows."
